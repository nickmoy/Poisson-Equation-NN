# Poisson-Equation-NN
Jupyter Notebook with a simple feed forward Neural Network setup using Pytorch to solve the 2-D Poisson Equation with Dirichlet Boundary conditions. I used a central difference scheme to calculate the discrete Laplacian over a 2-D grid and trained on the MSE between this discrete Laplacian and the given function. This has a good boilerplate setup for creating a neural network in pytorch using CPU (not Cuda). Also comes with visualizations of the solution and a graph of errors over the iterations using matplotlib.

# Poisson-Equation-NN
Jupyter Notebook with a simple feed forward Neural Network setup using Pytorch to solve the 2-D Poisson Equation with Dirichlet Boundary conditions. This has a good boilerplate setup for creating a neural network in pytorch using CPU (not Cuda). Also comes with visualizations of the solution and a graph of errors over the iterations using matplotlib.

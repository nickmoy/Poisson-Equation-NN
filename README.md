# Poisson-Equation-NN
Jupyter Notebook with a simple feed forward Neural Network setup using Pytorch to solve the 2-D Poisson Equation with Dirichlet Boundary conditions. I used a central difference scheme to calculate the discrete Laplacian over a 2-D grid and trained on the MSE between this discrete Laplacian and the given function. This has a good boilerplate setup for creating a basic feed-forward neural network in pytorch. Also comes with visualizations of the solution and a graph of errors over the iterations using matplotlib. The final calculation in the last cell also calculates the error between the predicted solution and the analytic solution of my chosen example.
